USAGE: ./splitnsend.sh <BD_HUB_URL> <BD_API_TOKEN> <JSON_FILE>

Requirements: Python3, BASH

This script will authenticate via API token with your Black Duck server, it will then split the submitted dry run file into smaller json files
It will then upload the json files into your Black Duck instance into separate code locations all mapped to the same project/version

You will probably want to move your original json here, you can uncomment out the line that deletes the dry runs once this is done for a fresh start
